# AminoAcid2RNASeq_RouteBasedMethod
Hi,

*Problem: 
    An amino acid can come from one or more RNA codons, meaning one amino acid sequence can be coded by one or more RNA sequence(s).

*Mission: 
   These codes are to convertan  amino acid sequence (alphabet sequence) to a list of possible RNA sequence(s) coding that amino acid sequence.


*How to Use: Run the code in either Main.py or AminoAcid2RNASeq.py
   Stop = "*" in the sequence

   These codes are a list of possible RNA sequence(s) in a csv.
   *Evaluation: "correctness" = whether the output RNA sequence can return the input amino acid sequence.


*Method:
   Inductive overlapping of codons between two adjacent amino acids.
